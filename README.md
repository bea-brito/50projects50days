# Day-one-50projects50days
Day one - first project from #50projects50days here on gitHub

This is my first try learning more about js and how he works when we put together with HTML and CSS;

 - In this challenge i made a carousel of 5 photos related to the state where I live in Brazil, called Cear√°. 
 - Also, I set out to add a theme change to the whole page using only CSS.
